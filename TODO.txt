- Convert button, led, serial and timer libraries to Contiki (integrate them into the rfa1 cpu and platform Contiki folders and use from there). See cpu/mc1322x for files for a good example of how to write the inner functions.

- Rewrite the SerialRelay file to use these new functions.

- Look at the French student's SX files, see if that can be also directly integrated into Contiki.

- leds is converted, but:
    the functions are in leds-arch.c, in the cpu/avr folder. It would be better if the functions could be in the platform/avr-atmega128rfa1 folder.
    the functions use variables in the <avr/io.h> file - the necessary ones should be extracted from there and defined in the file itself.

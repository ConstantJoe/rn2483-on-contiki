- Convert button, led, serial and timer libraries to Contiki (integrate them into the rfa1 cpu and platform Contiki folders and use from there). See cpu/mc1322x for files for a good example of how to write the inner functions.

- Rewrite the SerialRelay file to use these new functions.

- Look at the French student's SX files, see if that can be also directly integrated into Contiki.

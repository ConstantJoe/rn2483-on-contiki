- Convert button, led, serial and timer libraries to Contiki (integrate them into the rfa1 cpu and platform Contiki folders and use from there).

TODOs:

LEDS - done, but should move changes from leds.c to leds-arch. Also, leds_get just returns positive if a led is on, negative if all leds are off. Need to fix, but should be an easy fix. 

BUTTON - done! Pretty sure it works, but requires more testing.

SERIAL - Works now, but is quite messy. Needs a cleanup and refactoring (need to see if theres a way to only use one process for serial line).

RADIO - Going to test out the old rfa1 libraries first, see if I can call them properly from Contiki. Then I'll check out the cpu/avr/radio files (especially HAL) to see if the work's already been done.

TIMER - Timers look to be implemented!
	- Here's the official tutorial on use of timers:

Also, cleanup in general needed.

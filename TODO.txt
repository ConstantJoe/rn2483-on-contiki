- Convert button, led, serial and timer libraries to Contiki (integrate them into the rfa1 cpu and platform Contiki folders and use from there).

LEDS - done, but should move changes from leds.c to leds-arch. Also, leds_get just returns positive if a led is on, negative if all leds are off. Need to fix, but should be an easy fix. 

BUTTON - done! Pretty sure it works, but requires more testing.

SERIAL - one works, the other doesn't. I don't see why though? Going to try use the external serial library, just to ensure I've connected the rn to the correct port.

RADIO - to be tested, but probably won't work from the off.

TIMER - to be tested, but probably won't work from the off.
